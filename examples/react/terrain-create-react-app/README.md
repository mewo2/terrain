#### Terrain Create React App

## About

After discovering this awesome repo from the blog post, I wanted to play around with this codebase and begin to port it to React and es6. I like the concept of generating a random map but also want to explore tweaking it to my liking so that I might be able to use it in a game or story. Once I have editted the city names and have a map that I like, I should be able to save and export it. 

In this demo, I'm leveraging Facebook's [create react app](https://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2016/07/22/create-apps-with-no-configuration.html) tool to quickly get a React app up and running that uses the lastest es6 features. Then, I've added the latest version of D3.
